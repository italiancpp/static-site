In light of recent developments globally and the growing concerns around the spread of the COVID-19 virus, we have made the decision that this year’s Italian C++ Conference will be an <strong>online-only/virtual event</strong>. It will be scheduled for the same day at the same time (<strong>June 13 </strong>from<strong> 9 AM </strong>to <strong>6 PM </strong><em>CEST</em>).


The <a href="http://italiancpp.org/itcppcon20">event page</a> continues to be the main point of reference.

We do not have the resources to postpone this event.

<strong>We do not have experience with online events.</strong> If you want to help us, please <a href="https://www.italiancpp.org/chi-siamo/contattaci/">get in touch</a>. Also, please <a href="https://forms.gle/LzoifwnrwdNmxRzy5">respond to this quick survey</a>: we would like to get your ideas and to know what you could expect from the conference.

The event should include:

- live streaming of technical sessions (the schedule will be published soon &#8211; still waiting for speakers confirmation)
- virtual rooms for networking/taking a break/chatting
- other engaging activities, if possible

Attending the virtual event will require (free) registration. We&#8217;ll open the registrations in May.


We hope to see you soon, in some form or another.
Stay safe, stay home.

<h3>C++ Day 2020</h3>

What about <strong>C++ Day 2020</strong>?  You know, it depends on getting proposals to co-organize the event. Currently we do not have any. We cannot organize it totally on our own.


As usual, <a href="https://www.italiancpp.org/chi-siamo/contattaci/">get in touch</a> if you want to make this event possible by co-organizing with us.
