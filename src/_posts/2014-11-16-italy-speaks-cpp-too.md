<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Italy has a bunch of excellent C++ programmers (working here or abroad) and sometimes I have the honor to meet them. In this brief post I just like to tell you our latest activities, when C++ people meet, discuss and share knowledge. Every time we meet, new people join us. I think this is another proof of the high interest for modern C++ by the industry, the academia, etc.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We are promoting <a href="http://www.italiancpp.org/map/" target="_blank">this initiative</a> to gather Italian C++ people (and freelancers, and companies) on an interactive map. For free.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I&#8217;m spending more words about our meetup in Bologna and our workshop in Ancona &#8211; latest activities -, but first of all let me recap our first events/appearances:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Our first public appearance was in November 2013, when <a href="https://twitter.com/paolopolce" target="_blank">Paolo Polce</a> and I gave a talk at the <a href="http://www.agileday.it/" target="_blank">Italian Agile Day 2013</a>: &#8220;<em>Effective Code Tansformations in C++</em>&#8221; (telling stories about transforming legacy code to modern C++).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then, in February 2014, <a href="http://www.communitydays.it/" target="_blank">Microsoft&#8217;s Community Days 2014</a> gave us the chance to talk about C++. <a href="https://twitter.com/raffaeler" target="_blank">Raffaele Rialdi</a>, <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Speakers/Ale-Contenti" target="_blank">Ale Contenti</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_G_P_" target="_blank">Guido Pederzini</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alecsg77" target="_blank">Alessio Gogna</a>, and I gave a total of 6 talks (topics covered: introduction to C++11, new STL and boost, Visual Studio 2013, WinRT, Prototyping graphics by using Cinder and OpenFrameworks, legacy to modern). Great feedback and 40-50 people attended.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In June 2014 we met in Milan (Marco Foco helped me a lot with the logistics). Our first meetup, 4&#215;30&#8242; talks (topics covered: stories about lambdas, Async/Await, Actor Model, Type-Classes) and a Q/A panel, 30+ people attended. Our exceptional speakers were: <a href="https://twitter.com/glmeocci" target="_blank">Gian Lorenzo Meocci</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GPad619" target="_blank">Gianluca Padovani</a>, <a href="http://paoloseverini.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Paolo Severini</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolabonelli" target="_blank">Nicola Bonelli</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In September 2014 <a href="http://www.communitydays.it/" target="_blank">Microsoft&#8217;s Community Days 2014</a> hosted us again. This time a very special speaker joined us: <a href="http://bartoszmilewski.com" target="_blank">Bartosz Milewski</a>! We (Bartosz, <a href="https://twitter.com/MircoVanini" target="_blank">Mirco Vanini</a>, <a href="http://paoloseverini.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Paolo Severini</a>, and I) gave 4 talks (topics included: how foundations of C++ change by adopting new C++, WinPhone in C++, Persistent Data Structures in C++).

    Meetup Bologna
  </p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Last November 8th the Italian C++ Community gathered for the second time by organizing a free and entirely C++-focused meetup in <strong>Bologna</strong>. 50+ people attended, from different parts of Italy. <a href="http://isocpp.org/blog/2014/10/italiancpp-meetup-in-bologna" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find some details that isocpp.org published on its website (thanks for that).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I would like to express my gratitude to <a href="https://twitter.com/GPad619" target="_blank">Gianluca Padovani</a>, who was in charge of the logistics and he found a wonderful room, in the city centre. Besides I&#8217;m grateful to <a href="https://twitter.com/glmeocci" target="_blank">Gian Lorenzo Meocci</a> for taking lots of beautiful pictures. This event would have not been possible without our <strong>speakers</strong>, so thanks to (in order of appearance): <a href="https://twitter.com/bettazzoni" target="_blank">Roberto Bettazzoni</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BartoszMilewski" target="_blank">Bartosz Milewski</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DPallastrelli" target="_blank">Daniele Pallastrelli</a>, Gianfranco Zuliani. Last but not least, I wish to thank the <strong>attendees</strong>!

    Interactive Session: &#8220;Convince me to use C++14&#8221;
  </p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first session was completely <strong>interactive</strong> and I think it&#8217;s worth spending a few words about because this format is very common but I had never seen it applied to C++. Roberto moderated an <strong>interview</strong>, which the main topic was &#8220;why should I learn new C++?&#8221;. Starting by asking the question &#8220;which is the most important feature of new C++ for your daily work?&#8221; to some volunteers (Bartosz, me, and Gianluca). Lots of attendees expressed their opinion too. Another question was &#8220;which features would you like to be in C++17?&#8221; and the most quoted answer was&#8230; <strong>deprecating!</strong> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EGEHJblESsqhw_aMF42rBLG7PdTtZCwj0UOtfnAlkg4/edit" target="_blank">It&#8217;s worth having a look at the results here</a>.

  <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The last session was an interactive </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Q/A Panel</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. People led the discussion to &#8220;why should I use C++ today?&#8221;. Answers included these topics: performance, portability, interoperability, flexibility and elegance with no lack of control, legacy code. All of these questions arised from real working experiences.</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Yesterday, Gianluca Padovani, Marco Foco and I facilitated a 3-hours workshop at the <a href="http://www.agileday.it/" target="_blank">Italian Agile Day 2014</a> (in Ancona) about <strong>Refactoring in C++</strong>. Target of this workshop was to let people experience with modern C++ by solving issues on a quite old and smelling codebase. Clearly the codebase was under test (by using Google Test) and we started with a red test to fix 🙂
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  An interesting news was that people attending this workshop had almost no knowledge of modern C++ and some of them had just a little experience with C++! I consider this fact as another demonstration that programmers from other languages are curious and want to know why C++ world is changing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Issues to solve were about both making the C++ code more modern and fixing design smells. Not surprisingly, sometime design smells could be fixed just by applying modern C++ techniques/concepts rather than applying Object Oriented reasoning.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We had four categories of issues: <strong>productivity</strong> (e.g. simplify some parts of the code by taking advantage of initializer_list and range-based for loop), <strong>memory management and ownership</strong> (e.g. at some point we asked people to decomment an include file and suddenly almost all the tests became broken because of a memory leak. People had to fix it), <strong>algorithms and lambdas</strong> (e.g. some functions could be simplified by using an algorithm instead of looping manually) and a <strong>generic programming</strong> exercise to make tests more fluent (I&#8217;m writing a specific post about).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I was very happy people learned &#8220;naturally&#8221; (just by coding) the new syntax and style. We supported them and we introduced some concepts but they wrote code on their own and had great ideas. Most important: <strong>they had fun</strong>!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Next events we are planning fall in <strong>February</strong>. Stay tuned!
