  We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and we shall endeavour to use any information that you provide when filling <a href="https://italiancpp.org/cfs">this form</a> in accordance with this privacy policy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Currently, the <em>event</em> we refer to is the <a href="https://italiancpp.org/itcppcon19">Italian C++ Conference 2019</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we protect any information you submit to us through <a href="https://italiancpp.org/cfs">this form</a>, and how we use it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We may amend this policy from time to time by updating this page. Therefore, we suggest you check this page occasionally to ensure you are aware of and are happy with any amendments.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  What information do we collect?
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The personal information you provide are collected for evaluating your proposal and, in case, for publishing it on the event agenda. Only title, abstract and, if any, notes are used for evaluation but we ask some personal information to publish your speaker profile on the event agenda in case your talk will be accepted.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Such information are automatically sent to an internal email account and then stored in a private Google Drive folder. Such information are destroyed after the event or even before, if your talk won&#8217;t be accepted.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  How is the information used?
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Only when your talk is accepted, we use this information for the following reasons:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Name, surname, bio, title and picture on the speakers page.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Talk title and abstract on the agenda
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Notes, email and talk duration only for scheduling operations. Never shared
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Your information will not be disclosed to any third party unless you have given your consent to such disclosure.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  If you would like us to destroy information we hold about you, please let us know (send us an email at info [at] italiancpp [dot] org).

Your acceptance of this privacy policy

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do not submit any talk to our event.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  By submitting a talk through our site, you consent to the collection and use of information by us. Owing to the global nature of the internet infrastructure, the information you provide may be transferred in transit to countries outside the European Economic Area that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and its use as set out in this policy. However, we have taken the steps outlined above to try to improve the security of your information. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers.
