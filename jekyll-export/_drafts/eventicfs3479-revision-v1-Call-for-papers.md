  <span style="color: #2945a4; line-height: 1.5em;">Read here [icon name=&#8221;hand-o-down&#8221; class=&#8221;&#8221; unprefixed_class=&#8221;&#8221;] and then submit your proposal</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Currently, we accept talk proposals in both <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Italian</strong> (if you are confident with both, consider English).<strong> </strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Talks can be <strong>30-min</strong> or <strong>50-min </strong>long, however we are open to other session lengths and formats. In case, <a href="mailto:info@italiancpp.org">please reach out</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You can submit more than one talk.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You should submit a talk about anything you think it&#8217;s worth sharing with the <strong><em>C++ Community</em></strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> We maintain a list of &#8220;hot topics&#8221; emerged from feedback got at our events. These topics are listed after the submission form.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For example, have you learned something interesting about C++, maybe a new technique possible in C++14/17? Or perhaps you have implemented something cool related to C++, maybe a new C++ library.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As C++ developers, C++ is important to us. However, we are happy to host talks on other topics that can <strong>inspire us</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The <strong>Italian C++ Conference </strong>&#8211; <strong>as any other</strong> activity organized by the  <strong>Italian C++ Community </strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong>abides by<strong> </strong>the <a href="https://github.com/italiancpp/code-of-conduct">Italian C++ Community Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Submissions deadline is February 16 with decisions sent by March 7</strong>.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  Voting and decisions
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The Italian C++ Conference has no real dedicated program committee, all attendees of the past, the Italian C++ Community staff and this year speakers are included in this voting. Each vote is between 0 &#8211; 5 points per talk. Visible in the voting tool are usually only the talk info (title, abstract, notes only if important for the voting), staff members only are able to see also the speaker name and bio. More details on this once the voting begins.
</p>

Final decision is then made once the voting deadline has passed.

##### FAQs

> Can you give financial assitance to speakers?

_Short answer:_ unfortunately we can&#8217;t.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <em>Long answer:</em> since the event is totally not-for-profit, we have a very limited budget. The entrance fee will be very low (10€) just to soften the drop rate. The event relies on sponsors to cover the main expenses (food, drinks, setting, video recordings, etc). Clearly, in the rare case sponsorship funds exceed, our priority is to give speakers some form of reimbursement.
</p>

> <p style="text-align: justify;">
>   Are you planning a speakers dinner before the conference?
> </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <em>Answer:</em> defintely yes. The dinner will be reserved for speakers, staff and a few selected special guests. You can bring one guest.
</p>

> <p style="text-align: justify;">
>   Can you help find hotels around?
> </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <em>Answer:</em> we can recommend some hotels we know but, in our opinion, the best option for you is searching Booking, Expedia or similar websites.
