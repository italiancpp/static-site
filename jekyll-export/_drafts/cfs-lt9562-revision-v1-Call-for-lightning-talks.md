  <span style="color: #808080;">Call for lightning talks at Virtual Italian C++ Conference 2020</span>
</h1>

&nbsp;

#### Read here [icon name=&#8221;hand-o-down&#8221; class=&#8221;&#8221; unprefixed_class=&#8221;&#8221;] and then submit your proposal

**Duration:** 10 minutes

**Language:** English

**When:** June 13, from 12:10 PM to 1 PM (GMT+2)

**Important:** We maintain a list of &#8220;hot topics&#8221; emerged from feedback got at our events. These topics are listed after the submission form.

For example, have you learned something interesting about C++, maybe a new technique possible in C++14/17? Or perhaps you have implemented something cool related to C++, maybe a new C++ library.

As C++ developers, C++ is important to us. However, we are happy to host talks on other topics that can **inspire us**.

The **Italian C++ Conference** &#8211; **as any other** activity organized by the  **Italian C++ Community** &#8211;** **abides by** **the [Italian C++ Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/italiancpp/code-of-conduct).

**Submissions deadline is June 9 with decisions sent by June 10**.
