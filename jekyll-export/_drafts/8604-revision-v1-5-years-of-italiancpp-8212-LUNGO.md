<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Time flies. Today of 5 years ago I officially launched this website to the world.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Thinking about that day, I cannot explain why I was not worried about the future. I had no idea how to manage the community and I couldn&#8217;t imagine the difficulties to face with shortly afterwards. I was so excited that I just wanted to go live and put myself on the line.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In this post I will spill the beans about the Italian C++ Community. This story will cover pretty much everything I did. Why and how I started, when I made mistakes, what I changed along the way, when I felt I wanted to shut it down and when, instead, I felt proud.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I think 5 years is a great milestone. I started from scratch, my network was relatively small and I didn&#8217;t have any previous experience in managing something other than a small project developed in my spare time with a few friends.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Let me recap some numbers:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Officially started in 2013
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Initial staff of 6 people, doubled along the way
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Public announcement on June 24, 2013
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  My first C++ talk representing the community on November 2013 at AgileDay (ft. with Paolo Polce)
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  First public appearance of the community in Feb 2014 at Community Days, where we covered an entire track about C++. 50 attendees.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  First meetup on June 2014, half-day + lunch, 30 attendees
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Last event:
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Total number of events:
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Total number of people attending:
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Newsletter subscribers: ~1000
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A community is about people and I&#8217;d like to say <strong>thank you</strong> to all the people who have joined and supported the Italian C++ Community.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  TL;DR: this post is long. It&#8217;s our story, including details that I hope can be used by people who are thinking of running something similar. As a community leader, I made mistakes that I will try to explain. I will try sharing the experience I did from the trenches.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Stop here if you are interested.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Still here? Thanks for your interest, then. Keep your seatbelt fastened and enjoy the journey through the story of the Italian C++ Community.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  When and why everything started
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It is 2012 and while I am watching the videos of Going Native 2012, I am wondering why we don&#8217;t have any events about C++ in Italy. We have tech events about lots of topics but not about C++. We don&#8217;t have user groups neither.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Thus, this simple idea started shaping in my mind: &#8220;I want to make an event about C++ in Italy&#8221;.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I asked myself &#8220;What I need to organize an event?&#8221;. &#8220;People&#8221; I thought. That was my first target. No logistics, no money, no badges. My first target was involving <strong>people</strong>. &#8220;I&#8217;ll find the rest along the way&#8221;, I said to myself.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then I decided to start something, maintaining a low profile. I made Facebook and Linkedin groups about <strong>C++ in Italy</strong>. I called such groups <strong>++it</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  That name condenses everything: <strong>it</strong> for both Italy and the classical <em>iterator</em> name, prefix <strong>++</strong> for both C++ and advancing such iterator (as opposed to it++ that is not so idiomatic in C++). It was love at first sight. Probably a rare case of me being exactly right at naming!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Anyway, we were at the end of 2012 and such groups did not achieve a resounding success. I used to share news and resources about C++ on the groups but they were missing something fundamental: <strong>Identity</strong>. Two cold groups do not form a <strong>Community</strong>. A Community is made up of people and relations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  That was my first error: I thought I could involve people just by sharing links with them and commenting some social posts. I was not managing to build a community.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A few months passed. The beginning of 2013 was a terrible blow for me: my mum passed away on Feb 2.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I took a few weeks for myself and then I gave me two options: I could just give up and forget about my idea of community, or I could kind of turn around.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I chose the latter.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I&#8217;ve always thought that, in a sense, such huge loss drove my following commitment. Maybe my life needed to compensate, somehow.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then I started, seriously.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  The staff
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  March 2013 was crucial for the birth of the community. I spent some time shaping a vision and setting targets.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My vision was clear: the community will spread C++ in Italy, promote news and resources, involve people, support and help beginners and students, make events and meetups. In a few words: <strong>++it will be the C++ landmark in Italy</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I knew that most of the effort would have been on me, however I thought I needed a staff, a group of people I could rely on, who could help and that I could discuss with.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I had some good candidates among my &#8220;C++ friends&#8221;. I called them and asked to join me. They all accepted. Speaking with each of them I could collect further ideas and feedback. More or less we were aligned.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  At the beginning, the staff was quite small, just 6 people. It was distributed and each person was working in a different field. I&#8217;ve always deemed such heterogeneity was a killer feature. Along the way my staff grew a bit.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  The website
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  After forming the staff, the next thing to do was setting up a website. We identified a set of mandatory features:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  bloggin
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  general pages
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  events management
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  forum and discussions
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  newsletter
</li>
  * a section for beginners/students
  * stream of news and suggested resources

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We opted for <strong>WordPress</strong>. At the time, this choice was the most pragmatic possible. Now, I think I would choose something else, but let me talk about this later.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  WordPress had everything to support the features above. A few people of the staff had experience with some plugins and then we went for this way. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that we spent some effort to set up a social login to register to the website pretty much automatically just by using a social account among the most famous ones.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Let me just recap how we supported each feature:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  blogging: WordPress native
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  general pages: WordPress native
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  events management: plugin (The Events Calendar)
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  forum and discussions: plugins (buddypress & bbpress)
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  newsletter: plugin (Mailpoet)
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  particular sections: specific forums (e.g. beginners)
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  stream of activities/news: views on specific forums (e.g. last 3 posts on the forum news)
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  About the appearance of the website, we customized a bit a theme that does not exist anymore. We massively rejuvenated the website in Summer 2016 by installing a new plugin. I&#8217;ll get back to this later.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Another important thing it&#8217;s worth mentioning is about the C++ runnable snippets. In 2013, we were hosting the first blogging platform supporting C++ runnable snippets. Adding a snippet was as easy as surrounding some code with a wordpress shortcode. Stefano Saraulli worked hard to made this feature in a couple of weeks (in his spare time). We definitely did not promote well such open possibility and for this reason we had a relatively small number of articles in the years. The formula was easy: everyone could just fill up a form to become an author and access to our blogging platform.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now, 5 years later, our snippets are probably outdated. Platforms like tech.io offer a fully-fledged way to create interactive blog posts with entire projects under the hood.
</p>

#### Struggling with WordPress

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I said I was not so happy with WordPress. The staff and I have struggled a lot during the years. Sure, we are not experienced WordPress users, but we frighted against trivial issues like:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  some plugins crash and the whole website goes down,
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  administration dashboard unreachable for plugin errors. Manually edit of configuration files to restore,
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  not so easy way to have a local &#8220;test&#8221; environment (in particular on Windows),
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  many layout and theme problems, especially on mobile,
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  bloody updates: sometimes automatic updates just screw the website up
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Plugins are a great thing but I think sometimes some functionalities should be supported out of the box. For example, to make a table you can either write HTML or install a plugin. I find this unacceptable. A. Simple. Table.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  Beta-testing and then showtime
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I registered italiancpp.org in March 2013. For 3 months some selected people among our C++ friends and us tested the functionalities and then opened real discussions on the forum. Our forum was quite simple, including sections like:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  general discussions
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  news
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  learn (suggested resources)
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  compilers and tools
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  libraries and frameworks
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  On June 24 I officially announced the launch of the Italian C++ Community. The game was afoot.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first day we had something like 30 sign ups. We started collecting contacts. Now we have ~1000.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  ++it Rejuvenation
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I&#8217;d like to conclude the technical part of the story with this section. Afterwards I&#8217;ll spend some time on other non-technical topics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  After 3 years of experience with my community and collaborations with others, I developed a new vision on how ++it had to deliver contents and offer interactions between people in the future.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I did some statistics on the forum usage and I noticed  it was more or less unused or attended just by newbies. Online, people love discussing in several ways and platforms. Imagine that just because of the forum, the infrastructure was more complicated than a static website.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I started elaborating this idea of making ++it an aggregator of services and ways to interact. I coined the term <strong>interaction proposals</strong>. As a community leader, I basically offer to my people several ways to communicate, interact and build up relationships. It&#8217;s up to them which one(s) to use. I cannot decide for themselves.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I thought that having the forum as the central communication platform was restrictive, especially because it was mostly hosting beginner questions.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Then I worked a bit on the new theme, by installing <strong>evolve</strong>, a very cool and modern WordPress theme. I made news and resources feeds as twitter widgets
  </p>
