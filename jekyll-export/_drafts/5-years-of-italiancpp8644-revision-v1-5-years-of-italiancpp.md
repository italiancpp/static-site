<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Time flies. Today of 5 years ago I officiallyÂ launched this websiteÂ to the world.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Happy birthday ++it ğŸ™‚
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I believeÂ that 5 years is a great milestone. When I started the community, from scratch,Â my network was relatively small and I didn&#8217;t have any previous experience in managing something other than a small project developed inÂ the spare time withÂ a fewÂ friends.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  IÂ didn&#8217;t careÂ about the difficulties I would have face with, I was pumped for this new adventure andÂ I just wanted to go live and put myself on the line.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A community is about people and I&#8217;d like to sayÂ <strong>thank you</strong>Â toÂ all the people who haveÂ joined and supported the Italian C++ Community during the last 5 years.Â Some people have been very important for this tribe,Â in particular the staff members helping behind the scenes. At the very beginningÂ I started with <strong>Franco Milicchio</strong>, <strong>Raffaele Rialdi</strong>, <strong>Stefano Saraulli</strong>, <strong>Alfredo Di Napoli</strong> and <strong>Davide Di Gennaro</strong>. Along the way otherÂ great people joined the group. It&#8217;s worth mentioning in particular <strong>Alessandro Vergani</strong>, <strong>Guido Pederzini</strong>, <strong>Marco Foco</strong>, <strong>Illya Dudchenko</strong> and <strong>Gian Lorenzo Meocci</strong>. Thank you all!
</p>

      Italian C++ Conference 2018, Milan (200 persone)

</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  ForÂ the last 5 years, our commitment has been spreading around C++ best-practices and good resources, and connecting people with the Italian C++ ecosystem through the online community and events. We have organized events, given dozen of talks, facilitated workshops and produced articles and tutorials about C++, connected with other communities and events (not only about C++).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  IÂ feelÂ like sharing some words about the story of the community.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
</h4>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  When and why everything started
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  InÂ 2012, while IÂ was watching Going Native 2012, I started wondering why weÂ didn&#8217;tÂ use to have events about C++ in Italy. We had dozen of conferences every year about other topics butÂ C++. WeÂ didn&#8217;t have any user group neither.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then, a very &#8220;simple&#8221; idea startedÂ formingÂ in my mind: &#8220;I want toÂ organize an event about C++ in Italy&#8221;. My target was not so ambitious, I thought.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first thing I asked myself was &#8220;What do I need toÂ make an event?&#8221;. I thought a bit and then I answered &#8220;People&#8221;. That was my very first naive thought. That was true: <strong>events come with people</strong>. Management, logistics, money, badges, etc come afterwards. I needed to getÂ <strong>people </strong>involved<strong>.</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then I decided to start <em>something</em>,Â with a low profile. IÂ made two social groups, inspired by &#8220;C++ Enthusiasts&#8221; &#8211; a Facebook group that was really popular at that time and I made a Facebook and a Linkedin group aboutÂ <strong>C++ in Italy</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  &#8220;How do I call such groups?&#8221; I asked myself.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  &#8220;What about <strong>++it</strong>?&#8221; IÂ thought.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>++it</strong>, condenses everything:Â <strong>it</strong>Â recallsÂ both <em>Italy</em> and the classicalÂ <em>iterator</em>Â name &#8211; a typical C++ concept. The prefixÂ <strong>++</strong>Â is for both C++ andÂ also for advancing such anÂ iterator in a C++ish manner &#8211; as opposite to it++. &#8220;I like it!&#8221; It was love at first sight. ProbablyÂ a rare case of meÂ being exactly right at naming!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Anyway, weÂ were at the end of 2012 and such groupsÂ did not achieve aÂ resounding success. I used to share news and resources about C++ on the groups but they wereÂ missing something fundamental:Â <strong>Community</strong>. They were just cold groups. A Community is made up of people and relations. A community needs to be fed, continuously.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="color: #000000;">D</span>ropping a few comments aboutÂ articles and videos was not about buildingÂ up a community.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  A few months passed. At the beginning of 2013 I didn&#8217;t have time nor mind to think about my project: my mum passed away on Feb 2.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I took a few weeks for myself and then IÂ gave me two options:Â giving up orÂ turning around.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I chose the latter, as you know because you are reading this article.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I&#8217;ve always thoughtÂ that, in a sense,Â myÂ loss drove my commitment. Maybe my life neededÂ to compensate, somehow.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then I started, seriously. I put 100% of myself into the project, into the <strong>ideal</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  OnÂ March 26th I bought the domain <em>italiancpp.org</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Afterwards,Â I spent some time <strong>writing downÂ a mission and setting up targets</strong> for my community. Although ++itÂ hasÂ never been part of my job, I&#8217;ve took it professionally from the beginning. I think this point has been very important for theÂ evolution of the community.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The community&#8217;s mission is:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  spreading C++ in Italy by promoting news and resources;
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  involving and connecting people interested in C++;
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  supporting and helping beginners and students with C++;
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  easing relationships between companies and people interested in C++;
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  making events and meetups about C++.
</li>

In a few words:Â **++it&#8217;s mission is to be the C++ landmark in Italy**.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The rest of the storyÂ mightÂ beÂ covered in future articles.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  ++it Rejuvenation
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I&#8217;d like to spend a few words on theÂ massiveÂ &#8220;refactoring&#8221; I did in Summer 2016.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In 2016, after 3 years of experienceÂ withÂ ++it, I developed a new vision onÂ how to deliver contents and offer interactions to my tribe.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If you used to be a ++it user before that time, you remember we had a forum.Â RunningÂ statistics on the usage, I noticed itÂ was more or less unused orÂ visitedÂ mostly by beginners. But actually, people loved discussing in several other channelsÂ like facebook, emails, etc.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I startedÂ elaborating this idea ofÂ making ++it an <strong>aggregator ofÂ ways to interact</strong>. IÂ coinedÂ the termÂ <strong>interaction proposals:</strong>Â as a community leader, I basically offer to myÂ tribeÂ several ways to communicate, interact and build up relationships, <strong>all at the very same level</strong>. It&#8217;s up to them which one(s) to use, I cannot decide for themselves. My task is to make all such proposals at the <strong>same experience level</strong>. At that time, the forum was my first citizen choice. That was a mistake.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In addition, I worked a bit onÂ setting up aÂ more modern and engaging theme. The final result has been onlineÂ since August 2016.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  At the end, I got rid of the forum and then I disabled the registration of users (they can only subscribe SlackÂ and the newsletter). I replaced the forum with a dedicated subreddit and put more effort and moderation on Slack channels. The forum is not the central point of the community anymore. In addition, I worked on a <a href="https://github.com/italiancpp/code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Here are the <strong>activities</strong> and the <strong>interaction proposals</strong> of the community:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  SocialÂ channels (Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin)
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Slack team
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Subreddit
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Articles
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Newsletter
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Job offers
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Events, meetups and other social activities
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Moreover, I set up a bit of <strong>automation</strong> among some ofÂ the channels above. This wayÂ <strong>all the interaction proposals have exactly the same rankÂ and importance</strong>. People won&#8217;t miss updates just because they don&#8217;t use Slack, for instance.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For example,Â when I tweet adding the hashtagÂ #<em>news, </em>a bot spreads the same content to Facebook and Slack. Also, theÂ full stream of filtered tweet will be sent via newsletter at the end of the month.Â I could cover this automation in a future post, if you are interested.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  Next plans
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  &#8220;5 years have passed. What&#8217;s next?&#8221;
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You know, whenÂ you reach such milestones, you have to lookÂ at the future and set the next milestone(s).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Not being conceited, I think myÂ originaryÂ targets have been achieved:<strong> ++it is the C++ landmark in Italy</strong>. I amÂ glad when people tell me thatÂ ++it has been useful for finding job opportunities or important connections, whenÂ I read amazing discussions on Slack, and when students find help.Â Moreover,Â it&#8217;s very significantÂ that companiesÂ ask myÂ support forÂ recruitment in the italian C++ ecosystem.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>I have not mentioned that IÂ have developed a simpleÂ programÂ to help companies find C++ developers. If you are a company andÂ you need such a service</strong>, <a href="https://www.italiancpp.org/jobs/">please visit this page</a> (it&#8217;s in Italian, though).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  During the years, I have refined my original vision on ++it by introducing <strong>interaction proposals</strong>, I haveÂ previously described. From one hand, I have worked a lot on the platform/website itself by aggregating digital services and communication channels like reddit or Slack. However, I believe IÂ need to put more effort on <strong>openness</strong>. Let me explain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My next target is to reinforceÂ the concept of <strong>++it as an</strong>Â <strong>aggregator</strong>Â <strong>ofÂ activities and events not directly organized byÂ our core team</strong>. Basically,Â <strong>++it willÂ helpÂ people make activities, meetups and events about C++ in Italy</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  ++it willÂ patronize such events by flanking organizers and will offer visibility, network and advertisement.Â <strong>After 5 years weÂ have experience and network to empower willing people who want to make C++ activities in our country</strong>. IÂ feel lonelyÂ atÂ doing monthly C++ meetups in Modena! Why not having meetups in Milan, Rome or Florence?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As I announced yesterday at the <strong>Italian C++ Conference 2018</strong>, the very firstÂ experiment of this model isÂ the organization of theÂ <strong>C++ Day 2018</strong>, expected for November 24th in Pavia, which has been in the pipeline for some months, driven byÂ <strong>Riccardo Brugo</strong> and <strong>Federico Pasqua</strong>, willing students at University of Pavia. I&#8217;ve been supporting such good guys for some time but the biggest part of the job is on their shoulders. I will join the full organization during Summer.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  AdoptingÂ this model, I imagine the following activities:
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  (at least) 1 event per year fully organized by the core-staff (e.g. Italian C++ Conference);
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  (at least) 1 season of monthly meetupsÂ set where I live (Modena, at the moment);
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  any number of meetups and eventsÂ patronized by ++it but not 100% organized by the core-staff;
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  usualÂ core tasks like managing the community, selecting resources and news, making the newsletter, etc still ~100% on me.
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If you are interested in running events, activitiesÂ or meetups about C++ in Italy, even small ones, please <a href="https://www.italiancpp.org/chi-siamo/contattaci/">get in touch</a>.Â ++it and I will be very happy to help and give support!
</p>

I have written [this page](https://www.italiancpp.org/organize/) (in Italian) with more details.
